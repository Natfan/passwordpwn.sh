# passwordpwn.sh
A simple bash script that checks passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned API and tells you how many times that password appears in HaveIBeenPwned's dataset.
If it's a high number, the password is in common use and will likely be vulnerable to dictionary/brute-force attacks, and should not be used.
